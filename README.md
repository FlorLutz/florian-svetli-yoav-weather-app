# 4th Spiced Project

## Description
This was the forth project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. It was a group-project, in which my colleages, Yoav and Svetli, and I created a single page application using Vite and React to view the weather conditions provided by a randomizing API and show activities accordingly.

## Key Learnings
- getting acquainted with fetching data from API
- render react components conditionally on data provided
- set and change states with the useState hook

## Additional info
We decided for a dynamic background using gifs to illustrate the weather conditions.
